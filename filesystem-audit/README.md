## Setup audit

### Audit rules

### Event log filters

## Parsing audit data

### Using the provided script

For convenience, the `parse-filesystem-audit.py` script has been included for filtering audit data.

Uncomment one of the following presets:

```py
#list_all()
#list_OwOGame_Accesses()
#list_OwOGame_Reads()
#list_OwOGame_Writes()
```

or write your own script for parsing the audit data:

```py
# List all items
def list_all():
    for item in items:
        for key in item:
            print(key, ':', item[key])
        print()
```
