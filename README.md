## Analysis techniques

- The use of filesystem auditing for dynamic analysis is documented in [filesystem-audit](./filesystem-audit).
- The process of deobfuscating bbystealer is documented in [deobfuscation](./deobfuscation).

## Context

## Behaviour

## Incident Response

These are recommended steps for those affected by bbystealer.

Note that these steps are based on the versions of bbystealer I analysed.
Capabilities differ between versions of this malware and these steps may not be sufficient for different versions.

### affected applications

Discord Installations:

- Discord
- Discord Canary
- DIscord Development
- Discord PTB
- Lightcord

Browsers:

- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Brave
- Opera
- Yandex

Cryptocurrency Wallets:

- MetaMask
- Exodus

### compromised credentials

Discord tokens from affected Discord installations are compromised.
The victim should immediately log out of all Discord clients to invalidate any stolen tokens.

All saved passwords and cookies stored in the affected browsers should be considered compromised.
Passwords must be changed.
Any accounts currently logged into an affected browser should be logged out to invalidate session cookies.

Private keys for affected cryptocurrency wallets may be compromised.
Any cryptocurrency secured by these private keys should be immediately transfered to an unaffected wallet.

### malware removal

Malicious code is injected in some Discord installations and will remain active.
A file used by these Discord installations is replaced by malicious code.
To ensure the removal of malicious code and restore normal functionality to Discord, affected installations should be completely removed and reinstalled.

The nexe executable downloads and saves its npm package dependencies to `%homedrive%%homepath%.nexe_natives\`.
This is unlikely to create any security risk, but may be an undesired use of disk space for the victim.
